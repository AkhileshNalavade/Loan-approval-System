#About the Project

The **Loan Approval Prediction System** uses machine learning to automate the process of evaluating loan applications. This project aims to reduce the manual effort required and improve decision-making by providing accurate predictions based on historical data.

---

# Features

- Clean dataset preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multiple ML model training and evaluation
- Best model selection based on accuracy and performance
- Web application using Streamlit (optional if included)
- Predict loan approval for new applicants

---

# Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for web app)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

# Getting Started
